This is the R markdown approach to generating images that are saved elsewhere online.

You can add text

* and lists
* with extra bullets

You can *italicize* and **bold**

This is a [link](https://www.google.com/) to a good data science tool. 

Here's a link to the [about](about.html) page.

You can also still use R!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

plot_df = 
  tibble(
    x = runif(100),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
  )

plot_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
